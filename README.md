# Baldurs-gate-dnd-3.5
This is a WeiDu mod for BG:Enchanced edition that changes 2ed ADnD rules to DnD 3.5 with some elements taken from Pathfinder.

It changes game mechanics (i.e classes, spells, abilities, etc...) to that of 3.5 edition (to the extent that game engine allows).

Documentation will be posted soon.
