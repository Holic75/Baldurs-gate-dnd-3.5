	@001=~Shadow Form~
	@002=~Shadow Form
	
This ability temporarily transposes some of the user's tissue with shadow-material, making the subject partially incorporeal. For the next 5 rounds, all physical attacks directed against the Shadowdancer only deal 50% of their normal damage. During this time, the Shadowdancer is also under the effects of Improved Invisibility and cannot be directly targeted by spells.~

    @003=~Shadow Maze
This ability opens a temporary gateway to a small pocket within the Plane of Shadow. All enemies within 10 feet of the Shadowdancer must make a Save vs. Spell at a -5 penalty or become trapped inside a shadowy labyrinth as per the Maze spell.~
