@033=~SPELLFUSED WARDEN: Expanding beyond the bounds of druidic circles are those who dabble in the learning of arcane magic.

Despite this widely held outlook, druids and even other arcane spellcasters will occasionally seek the advice or aid of the spellfused warden when faced with an impossible challenge.

Wizards are rarely seen adventuring without a retinue of fighters and men-at-arms. Because there are different types (or schools) of magic, there are different types of wizards.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
@046=~JESTER: To be a Jester is to see the joke in every tragedy. For them, life’s a party, and most poor bastards are not invited. They live hard, play hard, and laugh hard knowing that at any moment their life might be cut short by an uncaring world. Jesters may play at being buffoons, but each is a student of life and of people, and they understand not only what makes people laugh, but what makes them cry. As adventurers, they often appreciate baubles and magical trinkets as much as anyone else, but their main goal is to have fun. When fighting enemies, their sense of humor takes a macabre and dark turn, becoming cruel and vicious to better demoralize their foe. As followers of the Laughing God Who Has No Temples, they are generally disrespectful atheists who wander the world looking for excitement and amusement, righting wrongs or committing crimes as the mood takes them.

Advantages:
– May use the Poison Weapon ability. Gains one use at level 2, and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.
– Laugh It Off: Fate protects fools and little children, and Jesters certainly adopt the role of fools. Jester receives a bonus to all <PRO_HISHER> saves per 2 points of CHARISMA above 9 (but also suffers a penalty per 2 points below 10).

The target creatures receive a Saving Throw vs. Spell with +2 bonus to avoid this effect.
At level 5 the enemies no longer receive a bonus to their Saving Throws.

//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
@047=~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May not wear any armor.
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling, crossbow.
– May cast arcane spells.
– Receives one bonus Feat at level 5, 10, 15, 20, 22 and 28.

– Gains access to the following epic spells: Comet (at level 21), Energy Blades (at level 22), Dragon's Breath (at level 23) and Summon Planetar (at level 24).

~
//----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
@0480001=~battle caster~
@0480002=~Battle Caster~
@048=~BATTLE CASTER: Battle casters are obsessed with the idea of personal combat. Although they possess innate talent with arcane magic, they engage in physical training to strengthen their bodies and reduce the inherent physical weakness that most sorcerers succumb to. Whether it’s a spell duel or a martial frenzy, the battle caster remains calm and focused in the heat of battle, waging war in the way he most sees fit and most surely ensures success.

Advantages:
– May wear light armor.
– May equip bucklers.
– May use the following weapons: long sword, short sword, katana, scimitar, dagger, club, quarterstaff, crossbow, shortbow, dart, sling.
– Have THAC0 and APR progression of a cleric.

– May not choose bloodline and thus may not receive bonus bloodline spells.
– May cast one fewer spell per level per day.~
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
@049=~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: they channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May not wear any armor or use shields.
– May only use weapons available to the Thief class.
– Has Evasion passive ability.

EVASION: this passive ability allows the target of an area attack to leap or twist out of the way. If subjected to an attack that allows a Savingthrow vs. Breath Weapon or vs. Wand for half damage, a character with evasion takes no damage on a successful save.

– May put stars in any fighting style except sword and shield and archery.
– Moves 2 points faster than other characters. Movement rate further improves by 1 every 5 levels.
– Gains Flurry of Blows modal ability.

FLURRY OF BLOWS: A monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, <PRO_HESHE> may make one extra attack per round, but all attacks take a -2 penalty. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears, thus ability becomes permanently activated.
When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack <PRO_HESHE> gets from flurry of blows, <PRO_HESHE> gets another one without any penalties.
When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes, with dagger(s) or quarterstaff.

– Damage dealt by unarmed attacks increases with level as follows:
  Level 1-3: 1d6
  Level 4-7: 1d8
  Level 8-11: 1d10
  Level 12-15: 2d6
  Level 16-19: 2d8
  Level 20-23: 2d10
  Level 24-27: 3d8
  Level 28+: 3d10

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
@052=~SHAMAN: Shamans forge a divine connection with the natural world, similar to the way Druids commune with nature, but Shamans are more spiritual than primal. They directly tap into the energies that flow through the earth and air, through plants and animals, and even through the dead, and shape these energies to obey their will. Nowhere is this more evident than in their ability to summon powerful spirits as guardians and defenders. A being of two worlds, Shamans value balance over dominance.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May only wear leather, studded leather, and hide armor.
– May not equip shields larger than bucklers.
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, club, spear, axe, quarterstaff, dart, sling, and shortbow.
– May cast druidic spells.
– Does not automatically learn all spells of a given level as Druids do. Instead, Shamans select new spells to learn at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.
– Gains immediate access to a number of Shaman-specific spells, which can be cast like any other: Spirit Ward, Writhing Fog, Spiritual Clarity, Spirit Fire, Recall Spirit, Spiritual Lock, and Ether Gate.
– Gains use of the Detect Illusion skill with 20% points as a base and an 4 points per level, up to a maximum of 100% at level 20.
– May use Shamanic Dance at will.

SHAMANIC DANCE: Shamans can summon spirit allies by performing a ritualistic dance. While dancing, the Shaman takes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and cannot move, attack, cast spells, use items and special abilities, or perform any other activity. Each round while the Shaman dances, there is a 35% base chance plus 2% for each level of the Shaman that a spirit will answer the call, up to a maximum of 75% at level 20. Summoned spirits stay while Shaman is dancing + 1 round /6 levels after Shaman stops dancing (1 round at level 1). The spirits grow in power as the Shaman gains additional levels:
  Level 1: Minor animal spirits (snake, fox, hound), up to 2 spirits at the same time.
  Level 6: Major animal spirits (bear, panther, boar), up to 3 spirits at the same time.
  Level 12: Minor nature spirits (lesser air spirit, lesser earth spirit, lesser fire spirit), up to 4 spirits at the same time.
  Level 18: Major nature spirits (air spirit, earth spirit, fire spirit), up to 5 spirits at the same time.
  Level 24: Greater nature spirits (greater air spirit, greater earth spirit, greater fire spirit), up to 5 spirits at the same time.
The type of the summoned spirit is randomly determined from all the spirits available at the Shaman's level. For example, a level 12 Shaman will summon either a minor nature spirit, a major animal spirit, or a minor animal spirit, but cannot choose which one appears. Spirits will do their best to protect the Shaman but are not controlled directly.

– Gains access to the following epic spells: Elemental Summoning (at level 19), Aura of Flaming Death (at level 20), Storm of Vengeance (at level 21), Energy Blades (at level 22), Greater Elemental Summoning (at level 23) and Ethereal Retribution (at level 24).
