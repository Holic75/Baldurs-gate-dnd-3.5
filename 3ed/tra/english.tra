//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
	@046=~JESTER: To be a Jester is to see the joke in every tragedy. For them, life’s a party, and most poor bastards are not invited. They live hard, play hard, and laugh hard knowing that at any moment their life might be cut short by an uncaring world. Jesters may play at being buffoons, but each is a student of life and of people, and they understand not only what makes people laugh, but what makes them cry. As adventurers, they often appreciate baubles and magical trinkets as much as anyone else, but their main goal is to have fun. When fighting enemies, their sense of humor takes a macabre and dark turn, becoming cruel and vicious to better demoralize their foe. As followers of the Laughing God Who Has No Temples, they are generally disrespectful atheists who wander the world looking for excitement and amusement, righting wrongs or committing crimes as the mood takes them. 

Advantages:
– May use the Poison Weapon ability. Gains one use at level 2, and an additional use every 4 levels thereafter.
– Laugh It Off: Fate protects fools and little children, and Jesters certainly adopt the role of fools. Jester receives a bonus to all <PRO_HISHER> saves per 2 points of CHARISMA above 9 (but also suffers a penalty per 2 points below 10).
– May Sneak attack for increased damage: 1d6 at level 3 + 1d6 every 5 levels thereafter.
– Bardic Performance: a jester is trained to perform to create magical effects on those around <PRO_HIMHER>. Jester can use this ability for a number of times per day equal to 1 + 1 per 2 points of Charisma above 10. At each fourth level a jester can use bardic performance one more time per day.
List of Bardic Performances:

Jester's Song
The jester is the master of the verbal put down, the hilarious joke, or the savage verbal lashing. Starting from level 1 <PRO_HISHER> words can inspire dread and outrage in <PRO_HISHER> enemies making them confused for next 4 rounds. The target creatures receive a Saving Throw vs. Spell with +2 bonus to avoid this effect.
At level 5 the enemies no longer receive a bonus to their Saving Throws.
At level 10 they receive a -2 penalty instead, which increases further to -4 at level 15 and -6 at levele 20.
	
Dirge of Doom	
A jester of 8th level or higher can use <PRO_HISHER> performance to foster a sense of growing dread in <PRO_HISHER> enemies, causing them to take become shaken and receive -2 penalty to their attack rolls, Armor Class and Saving throws. To be affected, an enemy must be within 30 feet and able to see and hear the jester’s performance. The effect persists for 4 rounds. There is no Saving throw against this ability.

Frightening Tune
A jester of 14th level or higher can use <PRO_HISHER> performance to cause fear in <PRO_HISHER> enemies. To be affected, an enemy must be able to hear the jester perform and be within 30 feet. Each enemy within range can make a Saving Throw vs. Spell with -4 penalty to negate the effect. If the Saving Throw fails, the target becomes panicked for next 4 rounds.

Disadvantages:

– May only use weapons a wizard can (daggers, quarterstaves, darts, slings).~
//-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
	@047=~SORCERER: Sorcerers are practitioners of magic who were born with the innate ability to cast spells. It is thought that the blood of some powerful creature flows through their veins; perhaps they are the spawn of the gods themselves, or even dragons walking in humanoid form. Regardless, the Sorcerer's magic is intuitive rather than logical. They know fewer spells than Mages, and acquire spells more slowly, but they can cast spells more often and have no need to select and prepare spells ahead of time. Sorcerers cannot specialize in magic the way Mages do. Other than these differences, a Sorcerer is very similar to a Mage.

CLASS FEATURES:

– May not wear any armor.
– May only use the following weapons: dagger, quarterstaff, dart, sling, crossbow.
– May cast arcane spells.
– Receives one bonus Feat at level 5 and every 5 levels thereafter.
– May not scribe spells into their spellbooks as Mages do. Instead, Sorcerers learn a small number of spells at each level, which they can cast daily without memorization.
– At 1st level chooses a bloodline which grants access to 9 spells (1 per spell level) in addition to those gained normally.
– Hit Die: d4
– Low THAC0/APR progression, High Savingthrows vs. Spell

	@0480001=~battle caster~
	@0480002=~Battle Caster~
	@048=~BATTLE CASTER: Battle casters are obsessed with the idea of personal combat. Although they possess innate talent with arcane magic, they engage in physical training to strengthen their bodies and reduce the inherent physical weakness that most sorcerers succumb to. Whether it’s a spell duel or a martial frenzy, the battle caster remains calm and focused in the heat of battle, waging war in the way he most sees fit and most surely ensures success.

Advantages:
– May wear light armor.
– May equip bucklers.

– May cast one fewer spell per level per day.~
//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
	@049=~MONK: Monks are warriors who pursue perfection through contemplation as well as action. They are versatile fighters, especially skilled in combat without weapons or armor. Though Monks cannot cast spells, they have a unique magic of their own: they channel a subtle energy, called ki, which allows them to perform amazing feats. The Monk's best known feat is their ability to stun an opponent with an unarmed blow.

FLURRY OF BLOWS: A monk may strike with a flurry of blows at the expense of accuracy. When doing so, <PRO_HESHE> may make one extra attack per round, but all attacks take a -2 penalty. When a monk reaches 5th level, the penalty lessens to -1, and at 9th level it disappears, thus ability becomes permanently activated.
When a monk reaches 11th level, her flurry of blows ability improves. In addition to the standard single extra attack <PRO_HESHE> gets from flurry of blows, <PRO_HESHE> gets another one without any penalties.
When using flurry of blows, a monk may attack only with unarmed strikes, with dagger(s) or quarterstaff.

– Damage dealt by unarmed attacks increases with level as follows:

Advantages:
– 2nd level: May cast Sun Soulray once per day.

//---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------//
	@052=~SHAMAN: Shamans forge a divine connection with the natural world, similar to the way Druids commune with nature, but Shamans are more spiritual than primal. They directly tap into the energies that flow through the earth and air, through plants and animals, and even through the dead, and shape these energies to obey their will. Nowhere is this more evident than in their ability to summon powerful spirits as guardians and defenders. A being of two worlds, Shamans value balance over dominance.

– May only use the following weapons: dagger, club, spear, axe, quarterstaff, dart, sling, and shortbow.

While dancing, the Shaman takes a -4 penalty to Armor Class and cannot move, attack, cast spells, use items and special abilities, or perform any other activity. Each round while the Shaman dances, there is a 35% base chance plus 2% for each level of the Shaman that a spirit will answer the call, up to a maximum of 75% at level 20. Summoned spirits stay while Shaman is dancing + 1 round /6 levels after Shaman stops dancing (1 round at level 1). The spirits grow in power as the Shaman gains additional levels:
  Level 1: Minor animal spirits (snake, fox, hound), up to 2 spirits at the same time.
  Level 6: Major animal spirits (bear, panther, boar), up to 3 spirits at the same time.
  Level 12: Minor nature spirits (lesser air spirit, lesser earth spirit, lesser fire spirit), up to 4 spirits at the same time.
  Level 18: Major nature spirits (air spirit, earth spirit, fire spirit), up to 5 spirits at the same time.
The type of the summoned spirit is randomly determined from all the spirits available at the Shaman's level. For example, a level 12 Shaman will summon either a minor nature spirit, a major animal spirit, or a minor animal spirit, but cannot choose which one appears. Spirits will do their best to protect the Shaman but are not controlled directly.

(Alteration)

Level: 6
Sphere: Elemental (Earth)
Range: 0
Duration: 12 hours
Casting Time: 1
Area of Effect: The caster
Saving Throw: None 

When a priest casts this powerful spell upon <PRO_HIMHER>self, an outer skin of stone will move up from the ground, completely covering <PRO_HIMHER>. This skin is of course magical and will hinder the wizard in no way. The effect of this is to protect the wizard from physical attacks such as melee weapons and projectiles. For every 2 levels of the caster, an additional skin is gained upon casting. For example, a 10th-level wizard would receive 5 skins while a 20th-level wizard would receive 10. For each skin the wizard possesses, the spell will stop one attack, so a 10th-level wizard would be protected from the first 5 attacks made against <PRO_HIMHER>, but the 6th would affect <PRO_HIMHER> normally. The skins will remain on the wizard until <PRO_HESHE> is affected by a Dispel Magic, all of the skins are removed due to physical attacks, or the spell duration expires. It is important to note that this will not protect the wizard from any magical attacks, such as Fireball.~

Thus, a creature moving at 6 and attacking once per round would move at 12 and attack twice per round. At the instant the spell is completed, it affects all ally creatures in a 30-ft. radius centered on a point selected by the caster (thus, creatures leaving the area are still subject to the spell's effect; those entering the area after the casting is completed are not). This spell is not cumulative with itself or with other similar magic. Spellcasting and spell effects are not affected. Note that this spell negates the effects of a Slow spell.~
