	@001=~Charm Animal, 10' Radius ~ 
	@002=~Charm Animal, 10' Radius 
    
This spell affects all animals in 30-ft radius around the caster. The animals are allowed a Saving Throw vs. Spell to negate the effect with penalty equal to one fourth caster level rounded down.

If the spell's recipient fails its Saving Throw, it regards the caster as a trusted friend and ally to be heeded and protected. The caster may give it orders, and the charmed animal will carry them out as quickly as possible.

If the caster harms—or attempts to harm—the charmed animal by some overt action, or if a Dispel Magic spell is cast upon the charmed animal, the Charm spell is broken. If two or more Charms simultaneously affect a creature, the most recent Charm takes precedence. Note that the subject will be hostile when the Charm expires, regardless of its original attitude. Also note that you cannot have a charmed creature leave the area where it was charmed.~
